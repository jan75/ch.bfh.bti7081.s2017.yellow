# CS1 Task 3: Our Process 
This document describes how we went about the task at hand: 
> Design a Web-based, mobile application for your target user by following the Design Thinking Process 

In this task we don't yet create the application. The target is to define the scope and the requirements by following the "Design Thinking" Process. 

But first we had to understand two things: 
  * What is borderline disorder? 
  * How does the "Design Thinking" process work? 
  
Learning what borderline disorder is wasn't that hard and time consuming. The term "Borderline Disorder" is more of a category for multiple mental health sicknesses. What we soon discovered was that together with our target user (Health Authority Manager) which mental health issue this was about in the end didn't actually matter that much. The application is aimed for use by a Health Authority Manager of a mental institution. 

We had more problems with the process behind "Design Thinking". In the end we worked not through iterations but jumped around between the different tasks (storyboards, prototypes, requirements, scope) and brainstormed a lot. 

Since we had 3 days where we all met at school the biggest part of the work got done on those days. These were Tuesday, Friday and the following Monday. Tuesday was spent learning what exactly "Borderline Disorder" is. We also brainstormed and defined (and later categorized) some requirements we found sensible and which would help us define our scope. Another important part was the interview with a "Health Authority Manager" which we planned to do by the end of the week and for which we defined the questions. 

On Friday we designed storyboards and prototypes. Our process, as mentioned above, wasn't very straightforward since we jumped around between the creation of storyboards, prototypes and (re)definition of our scope and requirements. By doing that we could improve the requirements perpetually. Sadly the interview couldn't be done by Friday and had to be postponed to Monday. 

On Monday we had the answers from the interview. With this and the already existing material (requirements, storyboards, prototypes) we could finally create our final document with the scope and requirements ([CS1-Task3-final.md](CS1-Task3-final.md)). In this document we compiled the requirements (by comparing our requirements with the answers from the interview), the best prototypes and storyboards. We also fully defined what is and what isn't in our scope for this web-based application. 

Lastly we created a presentation to present our results to the other groups.
