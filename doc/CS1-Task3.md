After that, we grouped the cards into the different requriements:

Notice: Our end user is the head of the psychiatry department. In short the colors: 

| Colour | Explanation                                                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Green  | Project-team skills and resources                                                    |
| Red    | Domain requirements. These requirements must be met regardless of the end user       |
| Blue   | Technical requirements                                                               |
| Black  | User requirements, the user being the head of the psychiatry department in this case |

### Storyboards
Based on the results from "Scoping" we created a first general comic showing how the end result could be used by the end user:

to

be

expanded

### Interview
To gather further input on the requirements, especially on the user requirements, we 
chose to do an interview with a head of a psychiatry department. To find good and 
insightful questions we each defined some questions based on the findings above:
