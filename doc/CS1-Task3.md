Notice: Our end user is the head of the psychiatry department. In short the colors: 
| Colour | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Green | Project-team skills and resources |
| Red | Domain requirements. These requirements must be met regardless of the end user |
| Blue | Technical requirements |
| Black | User requirements, the user being the head of the psychiatry department in this case |


### Prototyping
Based on the results from "Scoping" we created a first comic showing how the end result could be used by the end user:
