# CS1 Task 3: Exploring use cases and user requirements by the means of design thinking

### Initial Discussion
See [Discussion Results (DE)](media/CS1_Task3_Ergebnis_Diskussionsrunde.md) for a summary of the discussion results. See [CS1-Task3-process.md](CS1-Task3-process.md) for a description of our process in this task. 

### Scoping 
Result of a first brainstorm:

After that, we grouped the cards into the different requriements:

Notice: Our end user is the head of the psychiatry department. In short the colors: 

| Colour | Explanation                                                                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Green  | Project-team skills and resources                                                    |
| Red    | Domain requirements. These requirements must be met regardless of the end user       |
| Blue   | Technical requirements                                                               |
| Black  | User requirements, the user being the head of the psychiatry department in this case |

### Storyboards
Based on the results from "Scoping" we created a first general comic showing how the end result could be used by the end user: 
![Storyboard](media/CS1_Task3_Storyboard_2nd_draft.jpg)

In some storyboards we showed how the application could be used by the target user in different tasks:

The storyboards above give a general idea about how the app might be used. All storyboards can be found [here](media/CS1/Task3/Storyboard/).

### Prototyping
Some ideas we worked out in more detail and created prototypes:

### Interview
To gather further input on the requirements, especially on the user requirements, we 
chose to do an interview with a head of a psychiatry department. To find good and 
insightful questions we each defined some questions based on the findings above:
