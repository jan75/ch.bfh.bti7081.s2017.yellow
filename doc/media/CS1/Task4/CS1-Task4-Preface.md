## Introduction 
The patient management system (PMS) is applied by an health authority organisation to manage and analyse the care of patients suffering from mental health problems. The PSM is devided in several applications, each covering a part of a target user.
One part is that of the health authority management which we describe here.
The application supports the management by doing five main tasks to reduce the workload and risks which may occur by working with high sensitive data.
The whole system is build in a enterprise network for easy accessibility.

1. Patient management
* The process to acquired or mutated the date of a patient is running via the health authority management. Whereby a patient's treatment data does not belong to it.
2. Staff management
* A very central point is the administration and planning of the employees. Recruitment or dismissal are dealt by the health authority management. Also the weekly planning of the assignments and scheduling of the employees, also runs by the channel of the management. If an accidental event occurs such as illness, the management must change the mission plan or any dates.
3. Wiki
* Parameters of experience, treatment methods, news, etc. are stored centrally in a database. An online encyclopedia is used as a knowledgebase, which is made accessible to the various user groups.
4. Contacts
* Finally, then management must be able to access all contacts in the entire system. The access takes place for various reasons, on the one hand to provided for the patient and staff administration. On the other hand to contact the appropriate stations/organizations if an emergency oncures.
