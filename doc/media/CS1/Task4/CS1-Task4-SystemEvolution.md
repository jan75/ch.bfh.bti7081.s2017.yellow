# CS1 Task 4: Requirements Document Part "System Evolution"
For a more momentary view about the System Requirements check the corresponding chapter "System Requirements". A short overview over the components and technology used for this application:
  * Server
    * Webserver
    * Database Server
    * Backup server
  * Client
    * Mobile device
      * Phone
      * Tablet
  * Connectivity
    * Internet connection
    * Local network on customer site

## Where we anticipate and prepare for changes


## Where it's safe not to anticipate changes (which are relevant for this application)
**Web-, Database-** and **Backupservers** are built to match the requirements of today. Unless there is a massive increase like 3 times the current users using the application and therefore generating load on the servers the requirements in this area stay the same. But even if that should occur todays servers are scalable and no changes in the server side code are necessary.
